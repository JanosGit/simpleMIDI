# simpleMIDI
A class for easy accessing MIDI Interfaces.

I'm working on this from time to time, when there is some spare time.

At the moment, the most important MIDI functions work for Apple's CoreMIDI, next step will be adding some more sophisticated MIDI functions and adding an implementation for Arduino.

If there are any Windows or Linux guys out there, that wanted to help with a Windows or Linux implementation, just let me know!

Among others, a main goal of this project is to form the basis of [kpapi](https://github.com/JanosGit/kpapi), a cross-plattform solution to abstract all functionality of a Kemper Profiling Amp connected via MIDI.
